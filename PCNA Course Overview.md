My journey with the PCNA certification

My Snap One PCNA Certification Journey
How I Got Started
As part of my role in the networking and infrastructure team, my employer had been increasingly partnering with Snap One to standardize our residential and commercial client installations. We needed not just basic network installers, but people who could design, deploy, and troubleshoot enterprise-grade smart home and AV network environments.

That‚Äôs why they purchased the Pakedge Certified Network Administrator (PCNA) course for me. It was not optional. I was required to complete the full self-paced online training and hands-on lab work with live Pakedge hardware. The goal was to ensure I could confidently support our deployments using Snap One and Pakedge ecosystems, with in-depth knowledge of:

Building wired and wireless networks from scratch

Mastering Ethernet switching and VLAN configuration

Designing and securing enterprise Wi-Fi

Enabling secure remote access for client sites

Using OvrC to monitor and manage customer networks

My study guide was over 15 pages of detailed objectives. From subnetting and DHCP design, to PoE power budgets, to bridge priorities and spanning trees, I was trained to approach every home or small business deployment with the skills of a full network engineer.

Upon enrollment, Snap One mails a hardware kit that includes all necessary devices for hands-on configuration.

üì¶ Hardware Kit Contents

The kit provided for the PCNA course included the following devices:

1x Pakedge RK-1 Router

1x Pakedge SX-8P 8-Port PoE Switch

2x Pakedge WK-1 Wireless Access Point

1x Pakedge PDU (Power Distribution Unit)

1x Preloaded USB with configuration files & firmware

üß† PCNA Curriculum Summary

The course was broken into several structured sections, each focused on a core networking concept or device:

Module 1: Networking Basics

IP addressing and subnetting

IPv4 vs IPv6

DHCP vs Static IP

NAT and port forwarding

Module 2: Router Configuration (RK-1)

WAN/LAN setup

Default routes and DNS

Enabling remote management

Security best practices

Module 3: Switch Configuration (SX-8P)

VLAN creation and management

Trunk vs access ports

Power over Ethernet (PoE) testing

Switch diagnostics and port mirroring

Module 4: Wireless Access Point (WK-1)

SSID setup

Band steering (2.4GHz vs 5GHz)

WPA2 and MAC filtering

Wireless signal optimization

Module 5: Network Design & Troubleshooting

Identifying bottlenecks

Loop prevention (STP)

Multicast vs broadcast traffic

Logging and remote access

This repo documents my entire experience: from receiving the hardware kit, to completing lab exercises, to fully understanding what it takes to design, configure, and remotely manage a Pakedge-powered network.

I completed the full course, but did not attempt the final exam, so I did not receive the official certificate. However, the hands-on knowledge I gained has been directly applied to multiple real-world deployments.

This project serves as both a personal milestone and a reference for others thinking about PCNA certification or working with Snap One products in the field.
