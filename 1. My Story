My Journey into Networking

I began my career in technology like many do‚Äîcurious about how computers, devices, and systems communicate. My first experiences with networking was being the IT guy at home from a very early age, then proceeded to small office environments where troubleshooting basic router issues and Wi-Fi dead spots were considered ‚Äúnetworking.‚Äù Over time, my interest grew from casual fixes to an obsession with structured cabling, network diagrams, VLAN design, and security hardening.

I knew early on that understanding networking would be critical for any long-term career in cybersecurity and infrastructure support. So I sought opportunities to grow that skill set. My employer recognized this and enrolled me in the Snap One Pakedge Certified Network Administrator (PCNA) program to formalize and advance my knowledge.

The PCNA course was designed to transform technicians into full-service network administrators specifically for residential and light commercial environments. The coursework covered everything from understanding Ethernet fundamentals to mastering complex switch and wireless configurations. I was expected to not just pass the course, but be able to confidently design, deploy, and manage production client networks the moment I finished.

This repository documents my complete journey through that process.

üìò Overview

This repository documents my journey through the Snap One Pakedge Certified Network Associate (PCNA) course. It includes summaries of each module, my experience with the hands-on hardware lab, and networking concepts I practiced throughout the course. I completed the full course but did not take the final exam, so no certificate was issued.

This guide is written to help others understand what to expect from the PCNA program and to demonstrate the real-world knowledge I gained from it.
