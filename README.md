My journey with the PCNA certification

My Snap One PCNA Certification Journey
How I Got Started
As part of my role in the networking and infrastructure team, my employer had been increasingly partnering with Snap One to standardize our residential and commercial client installations. We needed not just basic network installers, but people who could design, deploy, and troubleshoot enterprise-grade smart home and AV network environments.

Thatâ€™s why they purchased the Pakedge Certified Network Administrator (PCNA) course for me. It was not optional. I was required to complete the full self-paced online training and hands-on lab work with live Pakedge hardware. The goal was to ensure I could confidently support our deployments using Snap One and Pakedge ecosystems, with in-depth knowledge of:

Building wired and wireless networks from scratch

Mastering Ethernet switching and VLAN configuration

Designing and securing enterprise Wi-Fi

Enabling secure remote access for client sites

Using OvrC to monitor and manage customer networks

My study guide was over 15 pages of detailed objectives. From subnetting and DHCP design, to PoE power budgets, to bridge priorities and spanning trees, I was trained to approach every home or small business deployment with the skills of a full network engineer.

This repo documents my entire experience: from receiving the hardware kit, to completing lab exercises, to fully understanding what it takes to design, configure, and remotely manage a Pakedge-powered network.

I completed the full course, but did not attempt the final exam, so I did not receive the official certificate. However, the hands-on knowledge I gained has been directly applied to multiple real-world deployments.

This project serves as both a personal milestone and a reference for others thinking about PCNA certification or working with Snap One products in the field.
